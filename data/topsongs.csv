Even If,MercyMe,"Sometimes you lose some
And right now, right now I'm losing bad
I've stood on this stage night after night
Reminding the broken it'll be all right
But right now, oh right now I just can't

It's easy to sing
When there's nothing to bring me down
But what will I say
When I'm held to the flame
Like I am right now

I know You're able and I know You can
Save through the fire with Your mighty hand
But even if You don't
My hope is You alone

They say it only takes a little faith
To move a mountain
Well, good thing
A little faith is all I have right now
But God, when You choose
To leave mountains unmovable
Give me the strength to be able to sing
It is well with my soul

I know You're able and I know You can
Save through the fire with Your mighty hand
But even if You don't
My hope is You alone
I know the sorrow, and I know the hurt
Would all go away if You'd just say the word
But even if You don't
My hope is You alone

You've been faithful, You've been good
All of my days
Jesus, I will cling to You
Come what may
'Cause I know You're able
I know You can

I know You're able and I know You can
Save through the fire with Your mighty hand
But even if You don't
My hope is You alone
I know the sorrow, and I know the hurt
Would all go away if You'd just say the word
But even if You don't
My hope is You alone

It is well with my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul",Inspiring
Broken Things,Matthew West,"I stopped at the gate
Thinking I don't deserve to pass through after all the mistakes that I've made

Oh but I heard a whisper
As Heaven bent down
Said, ""Child, don't you know that the first will be last and the last get a crown""

Now I'm just a beggar in the presence of a King
I wish I could bring so much more
But if it's true You use broken things
Then here I am Lord, I'm all Yours

The pages of history they tell me it's true
That it's never the perfect; it's always the ones with the scars that You use

It's the rebels and the prodigals; it's the humble and the weak
All the misfit heroes You chose
Tell me there's hope for sinners like me

Now I'm just a beggar in the presence of a King
I wish I could bring so much more
But if it's true You use broken things
Then here I am Lord, I'm all Yours

Grace is a kingdom
With gates open wide
There's a seat at the table just waiting for you
So, come on inside",Inspiring

Oh My Soul,Casting Crowns,"Oh, how you worry
Oh, how you're weary, from fearing you lost control

Here and now
You can be honest
I won't try to promise that someday it all works out
'Cause this is the valley
And even now, He is breathing on your dry bones
And there will be dancing

So Will I (100 Billion X),Hillsong UNITED,"There at the start, before the beginning of time
With no point of reference
You spoke to the dark and fleshed out the wonder of light

A hundred billion galaxies are born
In the vapour of Your breath the planets form
If the stars were made to worship, so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You've made
Every burning star, a signal fire of grace
If creation sings Your praises, so will I

God of Your promise
You don't speak in vain, no syllable empty or void
For once You have spoken
All nature and science, follow the sound of Your voice

And as You speak
A hundred billion creatures catch Your breath
Evolving in pursuit of what You said
If it all reveals Your nature, so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You say
Every painted sky, a canvas of Your grace
If creation still obeys You, so will I
So will I, so will I

If the stars were made to worship, so will I
If the mountains bow in reverence, so will I
If the oceans roar Your greatness, so will I
For if everything exists to lift You high, so will I
And if the wind goes where You send it, so will I
If the rocks cry out in silence, so will I
If the sum of all our praises still falls shy
Then we'll sing again a hundred billion times!

God of salvation
You chased down my heart through all of my failure and pride
On a hill You created
The light of the world abandoned in darkness to die

And as You speak
A hundred billion failures disappear
Where You lost Your life so I could find it here
If You left the grave behind You, so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You've done
Every part designed in a work of art called love
If You gladly chose surrender, so will I
I can see in Your heart, eight billion different ways
Every precious one, a child You died to save
If You gave Your life to love them, so will I

Tell Your Heart to Beat Again,Danny Gokey,"Like you've never been before
The life you knew
In a thousand pieces on the floor
And words fall short in times like these
When this world drives you to your knees
You think you're never gonna get back
To the you that used to be

Tell your heart to beat again
Close your eyes and breathe it in
Let the shadows fall away
Step into the light of grace
Yesterday's a closing door
You don't live there anymore
Say goodbye to where you've been
And tell your heart to beat again

Beginning
Just let that word wash over you
It's alright now
Love's healing hands have pulled you through
So get back up, take step one
Leave the darkness, feel the sun
Cause your story's far from over
And your journey's just begun

Tell your heart to beat again
Close your eyes and breathe it in
Let the shadows fall away
Step into the light of grace
Yesterday's a closing door
You don't live there anymore
Say goodbye to where you've been
And tell your heart to beat again

Let every heartbreak
And every scar
Be a picture that reminds you
Who has carried you this far
'Cause love sees farther than you ever could
In this moment heaven's working
Everything for your good

Tell your heart to beat again
Close your eyes and breathe it in
Let the shadows fall away
Step into the light of grace
Yesterday's a closing door
You don't live there anymore
Say goodbye to where you've been
And tell your heart to beat again

I Have This Hope,Tenth Avenue North,"Questions come and questions go
Was there purpose for the pain?
Did I cry these tears in vain?

I don't want to live in fear
I want to trust that You are near
Trust Your grace can be seen
In both triumph and tragedy

I have this hope
In the depth of my soul
In the flood or the fire
You're with me and You won't let go

But sometimes my faith feels thin
Like the night will never end
Will You catch every tear
Or will You just leave me here?

But I have this hope
In the depth of my soul
In the flood or the fire
You're with me and You won't let go

But I have this hope
In the depth of my soul
In the flood or the fire
You're with me and You won't let go

So, whatever happens I will not be afraid
Cause You are closer than this breath that I take
You calm the storm when I hear You call my name
I still believe that one day I'll see Your face

And I have this hope
In the depth of my soul

You're with me

I'm feeling like I'm falling behind, it's a crazy life
Ninety miles an hour, going fast as I can
Trying to push a little harder, trying to get the upper hand
So much to do in so little time, it's a crazy life

It's ready, set, go it's another wild day
When the stress is on the rise in my heart I feel You say just

Breathe, just breathe
Come and rest at My feet
And be, just be
Chaos calls, but all you really need
Is to just breathe

Third cup of joe just to get me through the day
Wanna make the most of time, but I feel it slip away
I wonder if there's something more to this crazy life
I'm busy, busy, busy, and it's no surprise to see
That I only have time for me, me, me
There's gotta be something more to this crazy life

I'm hanging on tight to another wild day
When it starts to fall apart in my heart I hear You say just

Breathe, just breathe
Come and rest at My feet
And be, just be
Chaos calls, but all you really need

Is to take it in, fill your lungs
The Peace of God that overcomes
Just breathe (just breathe)
Let your weary spirit rest
Lay down what's good and find what's best

Castle on the Hill,Ed Sheeran,"I was running from my brother and his friends
Tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass as I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here, made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know, I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way, driving at ninety down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer, and I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old smoking hand rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when we found
Weekend jobs when we got paid we'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way, driving at ninety down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer, and I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
Ones already on his second wife
Ones just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way, I still remember these old country lanes
When we did not know the answers, and I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

You Raise Me Up,Josh Groban,"When troubles come and my heart burdened be;
Then, I am still and wait here in the silence,
Until you come and sit awhile with me.

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;
You raise me up: To more than I can be.

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;
You raise me up: To more than I can be.

There is no life - no life without its hunger;
Each restless heart beats so imperfectly;
But when you come and I am filled with wonder,
Sometimes, I think I glimpse eternity.

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;
You raise me up: To more than I can be.

New Shoes,Paolo Nutini,"I'm looking tired and feeling quite sick
I felt like there was something missing in my day-today life
So, I quickly opened the wardrobe
Pulled out some jeans and a t-shirt that seemed clean
Topped it off with a pair of old shoes
That were ripped around the seams
And, I thought, These shoes just don't suit me

Hey, I put some new shoes on
And suddenly everything is right
I said, Hey, I put some new shoes on, and everybody's smiling
It's so inviting
Oh, short on money
But, long on time
Slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine
And I'm running late
And I don't need an excuse
'Cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes

Woke up late one Thursday
And, I'm seeing stars as I'm rubbing my eyes
And, I felt like there were two days missing
As I focused on the time
And I made my way to the kitchen
But, I had to stop from the shock of what I found
A room full of all of my friends all dancing 'round and 'round
And, I thought, Hello, New Shoes
Bye-bye blues

Hey, I put some new shoes on
And suddenly everything is right
I said, Hey, I put some new shoes on and everybody's smiling
It's so inviting
Oh, short on money
But long on time
Slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine
And I'm running late
And I don't need an excuse
'Cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes

Take me wanderin' through these streets
Where bright lights and angels meet
Stone to stone they take me on
I'm walking till the break of dawn

Bad Day,Daniel Powter,"You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
Tell me your blue skies fade to grey
Tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carrying on

You're standing in line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with a coffee to go
Tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carrying on

'Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song 
Just to turn it around

You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work on a smile 
And you go for a ride

You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down 
And you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

Well, you need a blue sky holiday
The point is they laugh at what you say
And I don't need no carrying on

You had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song 
Just to turn it around

You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work on a smile 
And you go for a ride

You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down
And you really don't mind
You had a bad day
Oh, a holiday

Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know
That you could be well oh that strong
And I'm not wrong, yeah

So where is the passion when you need it the most?
Oh, you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost

'Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song
Just to turn it around

You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work on a smile
And you go for a ride

You had a bad day
You've seen what you like
And how does it feel for one more time

Uprising,Muse,"The P.R. transmissions will resume
They'll try to push drugs that keep us all dumbed down
And hope that we will never see the truth around (so come on)

Another promise, another seed
Another packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed
And all the green belts wrapped around our minds
And endless red tape to keep the truth confined (so come on)

They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
We will be victorious (so come on)

Interchanging mind control
Come let the revolution take its toll
If you could flick a switch and open your third eye
You'd see that we should never be afraid to die (so come on)

Rise up and take the power back
It's time the fat cats had a heart attack
You know that their time's coming to an end
We have to unify and watch our flag ascend (so come on)

Edge of Seventeen,Stevie Nicks,"Sounds like she's singing
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh

And the days go by like a strand in the wind
In the web that is my own, I begin again
I said to my friend, baby, nothing else mattered

He was no more than a baby then
Well, he seemed broken-hearted
Something within him
But the moment that I first laid
Eyes on him
All alone on the edge of
Seventeen

Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh
Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Said ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh

Well, I went today, maybe I will go again tomorrow
Yeah, yeah, well, the music there
Well, it was hauntingly familiar
Well, I see you doing what I try to do for me
With the words from a poet and a voice from a choir
And a melody
And nothing else mattered

Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Said ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh
Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Said ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh

The clouds never expect it when it rains
But the sea changes colors
But the sea does not change
So with the slow, graceful flow of age
I went forth with an age-old desire to please
On the edge of seventeen
Ooh

Sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh
Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh

Well, then suddenly
There was no one left standing in the hall
Yeah, yeah, in a flood of tears that
No one really ever heard fall at all
Well, I went searchin' for an answer
Up the stairs and down the hall
A-not to find an answer, just to hear the call
Of a night bird
Singing ""Come away"" (Come away)

Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh
Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Said ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh

And I hear you at nightfall
And sometime to be near you 
Is to be unable to hear you, my love

Semi-Charmed Life,Third Eye Blind,"I'm smiling, she's living
She's golden, she lives for me
Says she lives for me
Ovation, her own motivation
She comes 'round and she goes down on me

And I make her smile like a drug for you
Do ever what you want to do, coming over you
Keep on smiling, what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you

And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show takes the stage
We give them the games we play, she said

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say goodbye

The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there
Some place back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take
Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break

It won't stop, I won't come down, I keep stock
With a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
And I bumped again and I bumped again
I said

How do I get back there
To the place where I fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to the place where you said

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say goodbye

I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be all right, all right

And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
The velvet, it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
Now I'm struggling to survive

Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties they pass the test
Slide up around the belly, face down on the mattress

One, and you hold me
And we are broken
Still it's all that I want to do
Just a little now

Feel myself hovering off the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down, no no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is all right, all right

And I want something else to get me through this life, baby
I want something else, not listening when you say
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there

In the place we used to start
